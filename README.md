# Inventory_System
I developed a comprehensive Inventory System with distinct roles for admin and customers. Admin functionalities include adding, viewing, updating and deleting products, along with monitoring current stock levels. Customers can viewing current stock and make purchasing products. Implemented using Java, J2EE technologies,HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
